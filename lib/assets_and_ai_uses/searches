->It sounds like the category list disappears when you tap on a category because the fetchProducts() function updates the state, triggering a rebuild of the UI. However, the category list should still be present unless something is resetting the state incorrectly.

Possible Issue:
When you call fetchProducts(categoryId: category.id), it resets the state, which may cause the category list to disappear.
The selectedCategoryId is being updated, but it might not persist correctly across state updates.
Solution: Ensure Categories Persist
Modify your fetchProducts() function so that it does not clear the categories list when fetching new products.

Update fetchProducts() in ProductListController
Modify how the state updates so that categories remain unchanged

->use for generate the ProductListState
